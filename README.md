# SARS-Cov-2 alternative RNA extraction protocol for Hamilton STAR liquid handler

This protocol uses 150 µl of viral transport medium and performs an RLT lysis and bead cleanup with a final elution volume of 20 µl of RNA, to be used in any RT-qPCR assay suitable to detect SARS-Cov-2. This protocol has been sucessfully tested with other respiratory viruses as well.

This method has been written for a Hamilton STAR liquid handler, but should also work on a STARlet or STARplus. The following  minimum configuration requirements must be met to make use of this method:

- 1 Shaker (or Heater shaker)
- 8 CO-RE channels
- a 96 MTP head for the 96 sample method
- 6 tip tray positions for CO-RE 50 (2 racks), 300 (3) and 1000 (1)
- Life Technologies DynaMag 96-side skirted magnetic plate #12027
- 7 free MTP positions:
  - 5 deep well plate positions
  - 1 magnet position
  - 1 PCR plate position
- a reagent carrier tray able to take the Hamilton 60 mL self-standing reservoirs

There are 2 versions: 

**COVID19_8Channel_24Samples_Final.pkg**
Uses only the 8 CO-RE channels to extract RNA from 24 samples at a time.

**COVID19_96Head_V3**
Uses the 8 CO-RE channels to distribute beads, the other steps are all performed using the 96 MTP head with liquid level sensing.

These programs were written for our specific configuration (Hamilton STAR X) and will need adjustments to the local deck configuration. We strognly encourage users to adopt the same layout since it minimises travel of contaminated tips to the waste position and across reagents and samples.
